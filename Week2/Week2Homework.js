//Homework week 2 Inside your JS file, create two variables: pizzaPlace and numberOfToppings

let name = "pizzaPlace";
let number = "numberofToppings";


//Have the variables reference the name of your Pizza Place
//  and the number of toppings your Pizza Place offers.
//
pizzaPlace = "Fortells";
numberofToppings = "9";


//print the variables and their types.

console.log("pizzaPlace")
console.log(numberofToppings)


//Print a template literal that uses both variables to construct a short sentence
// about your Pizza Place.


let message = `${pizzaPlace} pizza with ${numberofToppings} toppings is delicious`;
console.log(message)


//Construct an if statement that prints "Quality, not quantity."
//  if you offer less than 10 toppings, or "A whole lot of pizza."
//  if you offer 10 or more toppings.
let quality = 10
if ("quality >= 10") {
  console.log("Fortells offer a whole lot of quantity toppings for pizzas.");
}
else {
  console.log("Fortells offer varieties over quality.");
}





//Add, commit, and push your JS file to your GitHub repo.


//WHEN FINISHED: Send your TA a message to let them know
// it's complete and make sure that your Jira ticket for homework
// submission includes a link to your GitHub Homework.
